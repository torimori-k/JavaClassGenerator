# JavaClassGenerator

### How to Run
Install IntelliJ IDEA, and configure Antlr(4.9.2) plugin for this project.
Change "input.txt" under the root folder for different outputs.
The output Java file will be generated under "out" folder once you run the program.

Please note that this program is still beeing modfied, and it is only tested against some of the valid input cases. I am planning to add a testing program, and validation process soon.
